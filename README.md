# startup_name

A new Flutter project.

## NOTES
`final` refers to `const`
in a constructor, `{}` means optional parameters
`static` for classes is used to just be able to call a class and it's methods. We don't need to run `new` to create a new instance of a class. Example found in: MockLocation
Try to load images from a URL and not as an asset inside the project, otherwise the loading time is longer.
Look into 'theming' for style sin the flutter app. In this example, a styles.dart file has been created.
